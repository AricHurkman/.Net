# Unity and .NET

During this hour, you will be introduced to game development with Unity and .NET.

If you'd like to follow along, make sure you bring your Windows or Mac computer with Visual Studio Community 2019 already installed. Make sure you've installed with ASP.NET Core. Also make sure you have Unity installed.

If you want to try it out afterwards, no problem! This repo will remain publicly available after the event as well.
