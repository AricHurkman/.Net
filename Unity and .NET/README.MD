# Xamarin and Unity

During this hour, you will be introduced to Xamarin, a quick app building framework that extends the .NET developer platform. Learn how to quickly build Windows, Android, and iOS apps all with C#. 

If you'd like to follow along, make sure you bring your Windows or Mac computer with Visual Studio Community 2019 already installed. Make sure you've installed with ASP.NET Core. 

If you want to try it out afterwards, no problem! This repo will remain publicly available after the event as well.
