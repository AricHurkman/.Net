# Machine Learning with .NET

During this hour, you will be introduced to Machine Learning, Azure, and how to incorporate ML into your technical solutions. Whether you're building a web app or a video game, machine learning can help set your product apart.

If you'd like to follow along, make sure you bring your Windows or Mac computer with Visual Studio Community 2019 already installed. Make sure you've installed with ASP.NET Core.

Make sure you've also signed up for Azure. Remember, if you're a student, you can sign up for free _without_ a credit card by signing up for [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/).

If you want to try it out afterwards, no problem! This repo will remain publicly available after the event as well.
