# Build a Web App with .NET

In this hour, Scott Hanselman will introduce you to .NET and walk you through how easy it is to create and deploy a web app with Visual Studio Community Edition (FREE!), C#, .NET, and Azure!

If you'd like to follow along, make sure you bring your Windows or Mac computer with Visual Studio Community 2019 already installed. Make sure you've installed with ASP.NET Core. 

If you want to try it out afterwards, no problem! This repo will remain publicly available after the event as well.
